Repo provides a Python script for translating the contents of Excel files between different languages.

### Tackling the translation challenge

Finding the right tool to translate files with numerical data can be surprisingly tricky. Often, built-in Excel features, macros, or online resources donâ€™t quite cut it, especially when translating specific language pairs. 

I ran into this problem myself while trying to translate files from Russian to Ukrainian for business documentation. Existing tools just weren't up to the task. So, I created a custom tool to handle this specific translation need, making it easier to convert data files accurately and meet business requirements.

## Features

- **Automatic File Detection:** The script automatically detects the first Excel file in the current directory.
- **Language Translation:** Translates text from one language to another using the `translate` library.
- **Progress Indicator:** Displays a progress indicator while processing the translation.
- **Output Naming:** Saves the translated file with a prefix indicating the target language.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
python 3.11.9
```
```bash
pip install translate pandas
```

## Usage

1. Download the **translate_excel.py** file. Place it along with aimed .xlsx file in the same folder. Open a terminal and navigate to this folder.
2. Run the translation script from the command line as follows:
```bash
python translate_excel.py [from_lang] [to_lang]
```
- `from_lang`: The language code of the source language (e.g., `"ru"` for Russian).
- `to_lang`: The language code of the target language (e.g., `"uk"` for Ukrainian).
  
## Languages Catalogue
Look into - **catalogue.txt**

### Example

To translate an Excel file from Russian to Ukrainian:
```bash
python translate_excel.py ru uk
```

**IMPORTANT**: This script will process the **first** .xlsx file it finds in the directory. **Ensure that only one excel file you want to translate is in the folder!**
